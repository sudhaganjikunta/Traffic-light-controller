# Traffic-light-controller
This project implements a traffic light controller using Verilog HDL. The design uses a finite state machine (FSM) to manage traffic lights for four directions: North, South, East, and West. Each direction has Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs, and the FSM cycles through traffic phases with configurable durations for green and yellow lights.

The system simulates a real-world traffic intersection, ensuring safe transitions and only one direction has the green light at a time. This design is useful for learning digital design concepts, FSM implementation.
